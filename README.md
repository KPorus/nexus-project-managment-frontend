# Nexus Project Managment

A robust, role-based administration and project management dashboard built with React 19, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. This system is designed to handle secure user onboarding via email invitations, project lifecycle management, and administrative oversight with granular permission controls.

## 🎯 Project Purpose & Objectives

The primary goal of Nexus is to provide a secure and scalable foundation for internal tools where user access needs to be strictly controlled.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Secure Onboarding:** Eliminate open registration. Users can only join via signed email invitations generated by administrators.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure sensitive data and actions (like User Management) are restricted to specific roles (Admin) while allowing operational flexibility for Managers and Staff.
- **Data Integrity:** Implement "Soft Delete" patterns to preserve data history while maintaining a clean user interface.
- **Session Security:** Handle JWT authentication with automatic silent token refreshing to provide a seamless user experience without compromising security.

## Development Commands
Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```
Also Remember to change the backend URL in `request.ts` with you backend otherwise there will be cross issues
## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **Invite-Only Registration:** New users validate a unique token sent via email before setting their password.
- **JWT + Refresh Token:** Secure API communication with automatic 401 interception and token refreshing.
- **Protected Routes:** Route guards ensure unauthenticated users or users with insufficient role privileges cannot access restricted pages.

### 👥 User Management (Admin Only)

- **Dashboard:** View all users, their roles, and account status (Active/Inactive).
- **Invitation System:** Generate and track invite links for specific roles.
- **Role & Status Management:** Promote/demote users or deactivate accounts instantly.

### 📁 Project Management

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete projects.
- **Soft Deletes:** Deleting a project marks it as deleted/archived in the database rather than permanently removing it.
- **Filtering:** Filter projects by status (Active, Archived).

### 📊 Dashboard

- **Visual Analytics:** Interactive bar charts showing project status distribution.
- **KPI Cards:** Quick view of total users, projects, and personal contributions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (Slices, Async Thunks)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts
- **Backend (Integration):** Designed to consume a REST API (NodeJs)

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1.  **Real-time Updates:** Integrate Socket.io for live updates on project changes and user online status.
2.  **Advanced Filtering & Search:** Add server-side search and multi-criteria filtering for the Users and Projects lists.
3.  **Profile Management:** Allow users to update their own profiles and avatars.
4.  **Audit Logging:** visual log of who changed what resource and when.
5.  **Task Management:** Expand "Projects" to contain individual "Tasks" with drag-and-drop Kanban boards.

## 💬 Architectural Discussion

### Service Layer Pattern

The application uses a dedicated `apiService` layer wrapping a core `request` utility. This decouples the UI components from specific API implementation details. The `request` utility handles the complexity of headers and the specific logic for intercepting expired tokens to trigger a refresh flow.

### Redux Thunks

We utilize Redux Async Thunks for side effects. This keeps our components clean and focuses on UI logic, while the state management layer handles loading states, error catching, and data normalization.

### Soft Delete Strategy

Instead of physical `DELETE` requests that permanently wipe data, the delete action typically triggers a status update ( `isDeleted: true`). This is crucial for enterprise applications where data recovery and audit trails are mandatory requirements.
